///   For more information on what event handlers are, please read the
///   Serf documentation. This section will document how to configure them
///   on the command-line. There are three methods of specifying an event
///   handler:
///
///   - The value can be a plain script, such as "event.sh". In this case,
///     Serf will send all events to this script, and you'll be responsible
///     for differentiating between them based on the SERF_EVENT.
///
///   - The value can be in the format of "TYPE=SCRIPT", such as
///     "member-join=join.sh". With this format, Serf will only send events
///     of that type to that script.
///
///   - The value can be in the format of "user:EVENT=SCRIPT", such as
///     "user:deploy=deploy.sh". This means that Serf will only invoke this
///     script in the case of user events named "deploy".
